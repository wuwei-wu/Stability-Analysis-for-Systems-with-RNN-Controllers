# Stability-Analysis-for-Systems-with-RNN-Controllers

The code and data are the simulation results presented in the paper "Stability Analysis of Systems with Recurrent Neural Network Controllers", submitted in the 14th IFAC International Workshop on Adaptive and Learning Control Systems ([ALCOS 2022](http://www.alcos2022.org/index.html)).

All the code is written in MATLAB with the support of [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/), a Matlab-based modeling system for convex optimization.
